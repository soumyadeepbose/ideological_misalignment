# ideological_misalignment
This repo is for Study C of Project Aletheia. We try to quantify how easily can a large language model be convinced to support harmful ideologies, and do they change which quotes they produce when working under a certain ideology. This is a research-in-progress and we plan to couple this research with the emergent misalignment research later.
